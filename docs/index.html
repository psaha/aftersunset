<h1>Moonlighting with solar-power collectors</h1>

<p> The night sky is the source of countless beautiful pictures, and
there is no grander collection of them than the two-decade archive of
<a href=https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/lib/aptree.html>Astronomy Picture
of the Day.</a>

<a href=https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap100106.html target=_blank>Betelgeuse</a>

<p> Size \(R\) at distance \(D\) with light of wavelength \(\lambda\)
\[ \frac{\lambda R}D \]
</p>

<p> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betelgeuse
target=_blank>Betelgeuse</a> has \(R/D\) of about 0.25
microradians. </p>

<p> It's successor, the
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Webb_Space_Telescope target=_blank>
James Webb Space Telescope</a> will just about resolve
the giant star </p>

<p> At the moment, this is just a crazy idea and nobody is actively
working in it.  There is, however, a community of researchers working
in the general area <a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.03490
target=_blank>(here is a recent review)</a> who will pay attention if
the crazy idea becomes more realistic.  The research questions below
suggest some ways towards making the idea more realistic. </p>

<h2>Interference with partially-coherent light</h2>

<h2>Research questions</h2>

<h3>Which light sources are the most interesting?</h3>



<h3>Which photon counters should one use?</h3>

<h3>Which solar-energy collectors are best to work with?</h3>

<p> The conceptually simplest design has a parabolic mirror tracking
the sun, with a closed-cycle heat engine (a Stirling engine) at the
focus, attached to a dynamo.  As well as home-made examples by DIY
enthusiasts, there are industrial versions by companies like
<a href=https://ripassoenergy.com/en/media/>Ripasso Energy</a> and
<a href=http://www.unitedsunsystems.com/products-and-services/>United
Sun Systems.</a>  Solar Stirling is also </p>

<h3>How about a prototype?</h3>
