<h1>Moonlighting with solar-power collectors</h1>

<p> The night sky is the source of countless beautiful pictures, and
there is no grander collection than the archive of
<a href=https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/lib/aptree.html
target=_blank>Astronomy Picture of the Day.</a>  Over two decades,
they have shown everything from planets and moons to star-clusters to
galaxies to the largest scales of the observable Universe. One
category of astronomy pictures, however, is curiously lacking:
pictures of individual stars (other than the sun).  The best one can
find is <a href=https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap100106.html
target=_blank>this fuzzy image of of the star Betelgeuse.</a>  Why is
that? </p>

<h3> The problem </h3>

<p> The reason is that no current telescope has the sharpness to
resolve any star in the night sky.  Telescopes make stars look
brighter, but they still appear as point of light, or rather as the
diffraction pattern of a point source through the optics of a
telescope.  Resolving such a diffraction pattern into a picture of a
star requires a sufficiently large telescope aperture.  For a star of
size \(S\) at distance \(D\) seen in light of wavelength \(\lambda\),
the minimum telescope aperture needed is about
\[ \frac{\lambda S}D \]
Betelgeuse has \(S/D\) of about \(2.5\times10^{-6}\).  That is, its
angular size is about \(2.5\times10^{-6}\) radians.  Astronomers like
to measure small sizes in arc-seconds, which is 1/3600 of a degree.
Since a degree is \(\pi/180\) radians, and arc-second is about
5&nbsp;micro-radians.  Thus, in astronomers' units, the angular size
of Betelgeuse is about 0.05 arc-seconds.  The bar in the picture of
Betelgeuse marked `10&nbsp;mas' stands for 10 milli-arc-seconds.
Red light has a \(\lambda\) of about 0.8 micro-metres.  Thus
\[ \frac{\lambda S}D \approx 3\rm\,metres \]
for Betelgeuse in red light.  Ground-based telescopes have to contend with
turbulence in the atmosphere, which prevents them reaching their
diffraction limit.  Only space telescopes achieve their diffraction
limit.  The Hubble Space Telescope is not wide enough to resolve
Betelgeuse, but its successor, the
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Webb_Space_Telescope
target=_blank>JWST</a> will just about manage.
And that's just for Betelgeuse, which has an exceptionally large
angular size.  For most stars, you'd need a 100 metre aperture just to
resolve them.  And to resolve interesting features on their surface,
apertures of a kilometre or more would be needed.  It seems
hopeless. </p>

<h3> Interferometers </h3>

<p> Fortunately, the aperture of a telescope can have gaps in it.  In
fact, it can be mostly gaps.  That is, a few telescope elements spread
over an area (say) a kilometre across can achieve the same resolution
as a telescope a kilometre wide.  The light-gathering power will be
much less, of course.  But the resolving power will be the same,
provided the optical paths between all the elements are maintained in
phase.  Such telescopes are known as interferometers, and indeed are
related to Michelson interferometers in optics labs. </p>

<p> Interferometric telescopes are standard at radio wavelengths.  The
most ambitious is the
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_Kilometre_Array
target=_blank>Square Kilometre Array</a> which is under development
now.  It will have a collecting area of about a square kilometre, but
an effective stretching across Africa and to Australia.  It will have
spectacular resolving power for radio sources in the sky, but it won't
see stars, because stars don't have much radio-frequency emission.
Astronomical interferometers at optical wavelengths also exist, for
example
<a href='http://sydney.edu.au/science/physics/research/sifa/susi/'
target=_blank>the Sydney University Stellar Interferometers
(SUSI).</a>  A similar instrument (the now-decommissioned IOTA)
obtained the image of Betelgeuse linked above.  None of these has gone
to kilometre baselines.  Keeping the optical paths coherent over that
kind of baseline is very difficult. </p>

<p> There is, however, another kind of interferometry, which
side-steps the challenge of keeping the optical paths coherent.  It
has different names, intensity interferometry, the
<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanbury_Brown_and_Twiss_effect'
target=_blank>Hanbury Brown and Twiss effect</a> or just HBT.  It is
interferometry with partially coherent light.  It requires much more
light than ordinary interferometers, but it does not require optical
paths to be precise to a wavelength.  They need to more accurate than
the time-resolution for detecting photons.  The fastest photon
counters nowadays have response times of maybe 10&nbsp;picoseconds.
So optical paths good to a millimetre are good enough.  Less precise
is not fatal, but it does degrade the signal, so more observation time
is needed to build up the required signal-to-noise. </p>

<p style="overflow: hidden">
<img src='http://sydney.edu.au/science/physics/images/content/research/sifa/sifa/nsii.jpg'
style="float: right; padding: 0em 1em;"/> A stellar interferometer
using partially coherent light was built by Hanbury Brown and
colleagues in the 1960s.  In fact, it pre-dates the SUSI.  This great
instrument had two six-metre mirrors movable over a railway track out
to a separation of 120&nbsp;metres.  The photon-detector technology of
the time was, however, primitive compare to today's.  As a result, the
instrument succeeded in measuring the sizes of about 30 stars, after
which it ran out of stars bright enough for it to study, and was
dismantled.  There is interest
<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.03490' target=_blank>reviving the
idea</a> with modern photon detectors and going to kilometre
baselines.  But there is no specific plan so far. </p>

<h3> An idea </h3>

<p> Collecting light and bringing it to a focus, without trying for
optical coherence, has of course another and better-known application.
The <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odeillo_solar_furnace
target=_blank>Odeillo solar furnace</a> has been doing it for half a
century.  So do many other installations, which focus solar power to
run a heat engine to generate electricity.  And they are all just
lying around at night.  Could solar collectors be repurposed to
usefully gather starlight for astronomy after sunset?  Could
solar-power collectors moonlight as interferometers? </p>

<p> This suggestion, due to Olaf Wucknitz, is just a crazy idea at the
moment, and nobody is actively working in it.  There is, however, a
community of researchers working in the general area who will pay
attention if the crazy idea becomes more realistic.  The research
questions below suggest some ways towards making the idea more
realistic. </p>

<p> Development of such an interferometer would take years of work by
many people, not to mention substantial investment.  On the other
hand, a credible design concept for an instrument to image the
surfaces of stars far better than even the mighty JWST could do, and
that while subsidising its own construction by putting electricity
into the grid, should be pretty much unstoppable. </p>

<h2>Interference with partially-coherent light</h2>

<p> We know from wave optics that light from two or more sources comes
together, the amplitudes add.  But in our ordinary experience,
intensities add.  But intensity is amplitude squared.  How can they
both add?? </p>

<p> The answer to this conundrum is not difficult, but it tells us
something very important about interference, which isn't in
old-fashioned optics textbooks. </p>

<p style="overflow: hidden">

<source src="ampins1.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

In this and the following animations, consider the amplitude and phase
of light as a single complex number, which we may call the complex
amplitude.  <br/>

Here we have two monochromatic sources, whose complex amplitudes are
represented by the two blue lines.  The revolving lines show the
rotating phase.  The two complex amplitudes are added, and the white
dot represents the resultant complex amplitude. <br/>

As we can see, the two sources have slightly different frequencies.
As a result, the two sources sometimes reinforce each other and
sometimes cancel eath other.  That is, they interfere sometimes
constructively and sometimes destructively.  The total intensity
(squared radial distance of the white dot) beats between zero and four
times the individual intensities.
</p>

<p style="overflow: hidden">
<video width="400" controls loop style="float: right; padding: 0em 1em;">
<source src="ampins2.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
Here we have 20 light sources, with slightly different frequencies.
This corresponds to narrow-band or partially-coherent light. <br/>

The white dot is, in effect, the endpoint of a 20-step random walk in
the complex plane.  It's typical length is \(\sqrt{20}\) but in the
animation varies from about twice that to near zero.
</p>

<p style="overflow: hidden">
<video width="400" controls loop style="float: right; padding: 0em 1em;">
<source src="ampins3.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
This animation shows a superposition of two partially coherent sources
(blue and magenta), each of which itself consists of 20 coherent
sources with slightly different frequencies. <br/>

Because of the random-walk-like addition of the complex amplitudes,
the total amplitude is typically \(\sqrt2\) times as large as it would
have been with just one of the `blue' or `magenta' sources.  The
intensity will be twice as large. This is why incoherent light is
additive in intensities.
</p>

<p> Below we have two animations.  The left panel is actually the same
as the previous animation.  In the right panel, all the magenta
amplitudes have been flipped in sign.  Had all the frequencies been
the same (that is, had the light been coherent) there would have been
constructive interference on the left and destructive interference on
the right.  But what we have with partially coherent light is
different.  Both intensities vary, but they have a tendency to vary in
an anti-correlated way.  That is, flipping the sign of the magenta
causes a statistical anti-correlation in the intensities.  This is the
Hanbury Brown and Twiss effect, and the basis of interferometry with
partially coherent light. </p>

<h2>Research questions</h2>

<h3>Which light sources are the most interesting?</h3>

<p> The surface of the sun is pretty plain, but not so (according to
theory) the surfaces of high-mass stars (including Betelgeuse).  In
high-mass stars, the internal radiation pressure is much higher than
the gas pressure.  Indeed, it is radiation that holds up these stars
and prevents them from collapsing under their own gravity.  Now, when
you have a light fluid (in this case radiation) holding up a heavier
fluid (hydrogen and helium gas) you get a turbulent boiling surface.
The Betelgeuse image linked above hints at this, and would be very
interesting to observe in detail. </p>

<p> Also important are close binary stars, where material passes from
one to the other. </p>

<p> Still more exciting, if possible, would be to observe the
environment of a massive black hole, which is lit up by gas heated up
just before it falls in, with the event horizon itself forming a
silhouette.  The best candidate to try and resolve at optical
wavelengths is the black hole at the centre of the galaxy
Messier&nbsp;87.  There are ongoing observations of this system with
<a href='http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015ApJ...805..179B' target=_blank>
interferometry at millimetre wavelengths</a> with the eventual aim of
imaging the shadow cast by the black hole, but they are not there
yet. </p>

<h3>Which photon counters should one use?</h3>

<p> The basic observable in interferometry with partially coherent
light is fluctuations in intensity.  The more precisely one can
measure the individual arrival times of photons, the better.  A
<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-photon_avalanche_diode'
target=_blank>single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD)</a> is nowadays the
best type of device for this. </p>

<p> SPAD counters with very good time resolution are available from
<a href='https://www.picoquant.com/products/category/photon-counting-detectors/pdm-series-single-photon-avalanche-diodes' target=_blank>PicoQuant</a>
and
<a href='http://www.idquantique.com/photon-counting/ target=_blank>ID&nbsp;Quantique</a> and maybe other companies. </p>

<p> Since partially coherent light requires a narrow wavelength band,
one is counting photons only within a very narrow spectral range.
Ideally, one would like a large array of photon detectors, one for
each narrow spectral band.
<a href='http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014SPIE.9114E..0CT'
target=_blank>Arrays of SPADs</a> are still experimental but if and
when they become usable they will provide a big improvement. </p>

<h3>Which solar-energy collectors are best to work with?</h3>

<p> Odeillo has a fixed main mirror, with movable plane mirrors to
track the sun and reflect it onto the main mirror.  This type of
design associates different parts of the main mirror with very
different optical path lengths.  This type of design is fine for a
solar furnace, but no good for interferometry. </p>

<p> The conceptually simplest design has a parabolic mirror tracking
the sun, with a closed-cycle heat engine (a Stirling engine) at the
focus, attached to a dynamo.  As well as home-made examples by DIY
enthusiasts, there are industrial versions by companies like
<a href=https://ripassoenergy.com/en/media/ target=_blank>Ripasso
Energy</a> and
<a href=http://www.unitedsunsystems.com/products-and-services/
target=_blank>United Sun Systems.</a> </p>

<p> Stirling engines resemble the imaginary engines we know from
Carnot's cycle, and are a whole fascinating topic on their own.
<a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQb2sN6UWkA' target=_blank>
This explanatory video</a> explains how they work.  Stirling engines
have a reputation for being clean, efficient and low-maintenance, but
heavy. Heaviness may explain why motor transport has never adopted
them, but is not an issue when generating electricity. </p>

<h3>How about a prototype?</h3>

<p> It would be interesting to repeat the classic experiment by
Hanbury Brown and Twiss in 1958
<a href='http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1958RSPSA.248..222B'
target=_blank>measuring the angular size of Sirius</a>
using the same physical effect but modern instruments.  Two
amateur-class telescopes, equipped with high-end photon detectors and
electronics, should be up to the task
<a href='http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015MNRAS.446.2065W' target=_blank>
(detailed estimates here).</a>  In fact, even amateur-class telescopes
would be rather overdoing it, since optical-quality mirrors are not
necessary here.  Adding small Stirling engines for daytime electricity
generation would be a complete prototype. </p>
