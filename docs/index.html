<h1>Moonlighting with solar-power collectors</h1>

<p> The night sky is the source of countless beautiful pictures, and
there is no grander collection than the archive of
<a href=https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/lib/aptree.html>Astronomy Picture
of the Day.</a>  Over two decades, they have shown everything from
planets and moons to star-clusters to galaxies to the largest scales
of the observable Universe. One category of astronomy pictures,
however, is curiously lacking: pictures of individual stars (other
than the sun).  The best one can find is
<a href=https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap100106.html target=_blank>this
fuzzy image of of the star Betelgeuse.</a>  Why is that? </p>

<h3> The problem </h3>

<p> The reason is that no current telescope has the sharpness to
resolve any star in the night sky.  Telescopes make stars look
brighter, but they still appear as point of light, or rather as the
diffraction pattern of a point source through the optics of a
telescope.  Resolving such a diffraction pattern into a picture of a
star requires a sufficiently large telescope aperture.  For a star of
size \(S\) at distance \(D\) seen in light of wavelength \(\lambda\),
the minimum telescope aperture needed is about
\[ \frac{\lambda S}D \]
Betelgeuse has \(S/D\) of about \(2.5\times10^{-6}\).  That is, its
angular size is about \(2.5\times10^{-6}\) radians.  Astronomers like
to measure small sizes in arc-seconds, which is 1/3600 of a degree.
Since a degree is \(\pi/180\) radians, and arc-second is about
5&nbsp;micro-radians.  Thus, in astronomers' units, the angular size
of Betelgeuse is about 0.05 arc-seconds.  The bar in the picture of
Betelgeuse marked `10&nbsp;mas' stands for 10 milli-arc-seconds.
Red light has a \(\lambda\) of about 0.8 micro-metres.  Thus
\[ \frac{\lambda S}D \approx 3\rm\,metres \]
for Betelgeuse in red light.  Ground-based telescopes have to contend with
turbulence in the atmosphere, which prevents them reaching their
diffraction limit.  Only space telescopes achieve their diffraction
limit.  The Hubble Space Telescope is not wide enough to resolve
Betelgeuse, but its successor, the
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Webb_Space_Telescope
target=_blank> James Webb Space Telescope</a> will just about manage.
And that's just for Betelgeuse, which has an exceptionally large
angular size.  For most stars, you'd need a 100 metre aperture just to
resolve them.  And to resolve interesting features on their surface,
apertures of a kilometre or more would be needed.  It seems hopeless. </p>

<h3> Interferometers </h3>

<p> Fortunately, the aperture of a telescope can have gaps in it.  In
fact, it can be mostly gaps.  That is, a few telescope elements spread
over an area (say) a kilometre across can achieve the same resolution
as a telescope a kilometre wide.  The light-gathering power will be
much less, of course.  But the resolving power will be the same,
provided the optical paths between all the elements are maintained in
phase.  Such telescopes are known as interferometers, and indeed are
related to Michelson interferometers in optics labs. </p>

<p> Interferometric telescopes are standard at radio wavelengths.  The
most ambitious is the
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_Kilometre_Array>Square
Kilometre Array</a> which is under development now.  It will have a
collecting area of about a square kilometre, but an effective
stretching across Africa and to Australia.  It will have spectacular
resolving power for radio sources in the sky, but it won't see stars,
because stars don't have much radio-frequency emission.  Astronomical
interferometers at optical wavelengths also exist, for
example <a href='http://sydney.edu.au/science/physics/research/sifa/susi/'>the
Sydney University Stellar Interferometers (SUSI)</a> but none has gone
to kilometre baselines.  Keeping the optical paths coherent over that
kind of baseline is very difficult. </p>

<h3> An idea </h3>

<p> There is, however, another kind of interferometry, which
side-steps the challenge of keeping the optical paths coherent.  It
has different names, intensity interferometry, the
<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanbury_Brown_and_Twiss_effect'>Hanbury
Brown and Twiss effect</a> or just HBT.  It is interferometry with
partially coherent light.  It requires much more light than ordinary
interferometers, but it does not require optical paths to be precise
to a wavelength.  They need to more accurate than the time-resolution
for detecting photons.  With current technology that means about a
millimetre, but much worse can be tolerated. </p>

<p> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odeillo_solar_furnace
target=_blank>Odeillo</a> </p>

<p> At the moment, this is just a crazy idea and nobody is actively
working in it.  There is, however, a community of researchers working
in the general area <a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.03490
target=_blank>(here is a recent review)</a> who will pay attention if
the crazy idea becomes more realistic.  The research questions below
suggest some ways towards making the idea more realistic. </p>

<h2>Interference with partially-coherent light</h2>

<p> We know from wave optics that light from two or more sources comes
together, the amplitudes add.  But in our ordinary experience,
intensities add.  But intensity is amplitude squared.  How can they
both add?? </p>

<p> The answer to this conundrum is not difficult, but it tells us
something very important about interference, which isn't in
old-fashioned optics textbooks. </p>

In this and the following animations, consider the amplitude and phase
of light as a single complex number, which we may call the complex
amplitude.  <br/>

Here we have two monochromatic sources, whose complex amplitudes are
represented by the two blue lines.  The revolving lines show the
rotating phase.  The two complex amplitudes are added, and the white
dot represents the resultant complex amplitude. <br/>

As we can see, the two sources have slightly different frequencies.
As a result, the two sources sometimes reinforce each other and
sometimes cancel eath other.  That is, they interfere sometimes
constructively and sometimes destructively.  The total intensity
(squared radial distance of the white dot) beats between zero and four
times the individual intensities.

Here we have 20 light sources, with slightly different frequencies.
This corresponds to narrow-band or partially-coherent light. <br/>

The white dot is, in effect, the endpoint of a 20-step random walk in
the complex plane.  It's typical length is \(\sqrt{20}\) but in the
animation varies from about twice that to near zero.

<h2>Research questions</h2>

<h3>Which light sources are the most interesting?</h3>



<h3>Which photon counters should one use?</h3>

<h3>Which solar-energy collectors are best to work with?</h3>

<p> The conceptually simplest design has a parabolic mirror tracking
the sun, with a closed-cycle heat engine (a Stirling engine) at the
focus, attached to a dynamo.  As well as home-made examples by DIY
enthusiasts, there are industrial versions by companies like
<a href=https://ripassoenergy.com/en/media/>Ripasso Energy</a> and
<a href=http://www.unitedsunsystems.com/products-and-services/>United
Sun Systems.</a> </p>

<p> Odeillo has a fixed main mirror, with movable plane mirrors to
track the sun and reflect it onto the main mirror.  This type of
design associates different parts of the main mirror with very
different optical path lengths.  This type of design is fine for a
solar furnace, but no good for interferometry. </p>

<p> Stirling engines are not far from the imaginary engines we know
from Carnot's cycle, and are a whole fascinating topic on their own.
<a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQb2sN6UWkA' target=_blank>
This explanatory video</a> explains how they work.  Stirling engines
have a reputation for being clean, efficient and low-maintenance, but
heavy. Heaviness may explain why motor transport has never adopted
them, but is not an issue when generating electricity. </p>

<h3>How about a prototype?</h3>
