<h1>Moonlighting with solar-power collectors</h1>

<p> The night sky is the source of countless beautiful pictures, and
there is no grander collection of them than the two-decade archive of
<a href=https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/lib/aptree.html>Astronomy Picture
of the Day.</a>

<a href=https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap100106.html target=_blank>Betelgeuse</a>

<p> Size \(R\) at distance \(D\) with light of wavelength \(\lambda\)
\[ \frac{\lambda R}D \]
</p>

<p> <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betelgeuse
target=_blank>Betelgeuse</a> has \(R/D\) of about 0.25
microradians. </p>

<p> It's successor, the
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Webb_Space_Telescope target=_blank>
James Webb Space Telescope</a> will just about resolve
the giant star </p>

<p> At the moment, this is just a crazy idea and nobody is actively
working in it.  There is, however, a community of researchers working
in the general area <a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.03490
target=_blank>(here is a recent review)</a> who will pay attention if
the crazy idea becomes more realistic.  The research questions below
suggest some ways towards making the idea more realistic. </p>

<h2>Interference with partially-coherent light</h2>

<p> We know from wave optics that light from two or more sources comes
together, the amplitudes add.  But in our ordinary experience,
intensities add.  But intensity is amplitude squared.  How can they
both add?? </p>

<p> The answer to this conundrum is not difficult, but it tells us
something very important about interference, which isn't in
old-fashioned optics textbooks. </p>

In this and the following animations, consider the amplitude and phase
of light as a single complex number, which we may call the complex
amplitude.  <br/>

Here we have two monochromatic sources, whose complex amplitudes are
represented by the two blue lines.  The revolving lines show the
rotating phase.  The two complex amplitudes are added, and the white
dot represents the resultant complex amplitude. <br/>

As we can see, the two sources have slightly different frequencies.
As a result, the two sources sometimes reinforce each other and
sometimes cancel eath other.  That is, they interfere sometimes
constructively and sometimes destructively.  The total intensity
(squared radial distance of the white dot) beats between zero and four
times the individual intensities.

Here we have 20 light sources, with slightly different frequencies.
This corresponds to narrow-band or partially-coherent light. <br/>

The white dot is, in effect, the endpoint of a 20-step random walk in
the complex plane.  It's typical length is \(\sqrt{20}\) but in the
animation varies from about twice that to near zero.

<h2>Research questions</h2>

<h3>Which light sources are the most interesting?</h3>



<h3>Which photon counters should one use?</h3>

<h3>Which solar-energy collectors are best to work with?</h3>

<p> The conceptually simplest design has a parabolic mirror tracking
the sun, with a closed-cycle heat engine (a Stirling engine) at the
focus, attached to a dynamo.  As well as home-made examples by DIY
enthusiasts, there are industrial versions by companies like
<a href=https://ripassoenergy.com/en/media/>Ripasso Energy</a> and
<a href=http://www.unitedsunsystems.com/products-and-services/>United
Sun Systems.</a>  Solar Stirling is also </p>

<h3>How about a prototype?</h3>
