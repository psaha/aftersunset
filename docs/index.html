<h1>Moonlighting with solar-power collectors</h1>

<p> The night sky is the source of countless beautiful pictures, and
there is no grander collection than the archive of
<a href=https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/lib/aptree.html>Astronomy Picture
of the Day.</a>  Over two decades, they have shown everything from
planets and moons to star-clusters to galaxies to the largest scales
of the observable Universe. One category of astronomy pictures,
however, is curiously lacking: pictures of individual stars (other
than the sun).  The best one can find is
<a href=https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap100106.html target=_blank>this
fuzzy image of of the star Betelgeuse.</a>  Why is that? </p>

<p> The reason is that no current telescope has the sharpness to
resolve any star in the night sky.  Telescopes make stars look
brighter, but they still appear as point of light, or rather as the
diffraction pattern of a point source through the optics of a
telescope.  Resolving such a diffraction pattern into a picture of a
star requires a sufficiently large telescope aperture.  For a star of
size \(S\) at distance \(D\) seen in light of wavelength \(\lambda\),
the minimum telescope aperture needed is about
\[ \frac{\lambda S}D \]
Betelgeuse has \(S/D\) of about \(3\times10^{-6}\)  That is, it has
an angular size of 0.3 microradians.  (Recall that a degree is
\(\pi/180\) radians.  The astronomers' unit of arc-second is a
degree/360 or 6.7 microradians.  The bar in the picture of Betelgeuse
marked `10&nbsp;mas' stands for 10 milli-arc-seconds or about 30
nano-radians.)   For visible light
\[ \frac{\lambda S}D \approx 3\rm\,metres \]
for Betelgeuse.  Now ground-based telescopes have to contend with
turbulence in the atmosphere, which prevents them reaching their
diffraction limit.  Only space telescopes achieve their diffraction
limit.  The Hubble Space Telescope is not wide enough to resolve
Betelgeuse, but its successor, the
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Webb_Space_Telescope
target=_blank> James Webb Space Telescope</a> will just about manage.
And that's just for Betelgeuse, which has an exceptionally large
angular size.  For most stars, you'd need a 100 metre aperture just to
resolve them.  And to resolve interesting features on their surface,
apertures of a kilometre of more would be needed.  It seems hopeless. </p>

<p> At the moment, this is just a crazy idea and nobody is actively
working in it.  There is, however, a community of researchers working
in the general area <a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.03490
target=_blank>(here is a recent review)</a> who will pay attention if
the crazy idea becomes more realistic.  The research questions below
suggest some ways towards making the idea more realistic. </p>

<h2>Interference with partially-coherent light</h2>

<h2>Research questions</h2>

<h3>Which light sources are the most interesting?</h3>



<h3>Which photon counters should one use?</h3>

<h3>Which solar-energy collectors are best to work with?</h3>

<p> The conceptually simplest design has a parabolic mirror tracking
the sun, with a closed-cycle heat engine (a Stirling engine) at the
focus, attached to a dynamo.  As well as home-made examples by DIY
enthusiasts, there are industrial versions by companies like
<a href=https://ripassoenergy.com/en/media/>Ripasso Energy</a> and
<a href=http://www.unitedsunsystems.com/products-and-services/>United
Sun Systems.</a>  Solar Stirling is also </p>

<h3>How about a prototype?</h3>
